    <p>Welcome to the Step By Step School, awarded the Best School in India by Education World 2019.
        <br><br>
    
        CORE BELIEFS<br><br>
Our mission is to provide a caring, healthy and challenging environment where children prepare to meet with confidence, imagination, and integrity, the challenges of life. <br>
In partnership with supportive families, we strive to develop in each child the desire and discipline to grow in wisdom, to lead lives of personal honour, to embrace diversity, to appreciate beauty, to pursue physical well being and to interact with others with a generous and compassionate spirit. <br>
<br><br><br>
THE JOURNEY SO FAR<br><br>
The Step By Step School, Noida has grown out of Step by Step Nursery School, a leading preschool in Panchsheel Park New Delhi, synonymous with quality, a loving environment where young children are watched over by a committed and nurturing faculty and a creative curriculum which focuses on learning through activity and play.<br>
The Step by Step School, Noida takes forward all these hallmarks of quality and builds on them to provide a unique educational opportunity from preschool to school leaving certification.
 The senior leadership team of Principal and Heads of School came on board in 2007 and jointly developed a distinctive academic and co-curricular program. The school opened its doors in April 2008 to 547 students from the Toddler programme to class six. Spread over ten acres of land, initially we occupied three floors of the Junior school, the creative play area and the junior playing field. Within a span of two years we expanded to the senior wing, then the admin block in 2013 and finally the state of the art auditorium block in 2018. Presently our school strength stands at 2258, with a staff strength at 336 and a student teacher ratio of 8:1.
